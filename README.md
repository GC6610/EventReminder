# EventReminder
This program helps you to get notified for the event before hand itself with an small buzz sound and takes you to the required events website.
You can store all your events of the upcoming week in a schedule.txt and the program will do the rest of the work and will act as a reminder for all your events in your schedule file.
You can also add/remove events from the text file.
